Bohemia has been a glass-making region since the 12th century, but by combining their native chalk with potash in a new method the Bohemian glass-makers are now finally able to challenge the Venetian glass. The new strand of Bohemian crystal is both more durable, brilliant and distinctly different in its style form the Venetian glass. Bohemian crystal chandeliers, glass jewelry, and engraved glass is rapidly becoming a common sight in all the courts of Europe.",

Under the Idrisids and Marinids, the northern city of Fez has been the favored seat of government, allowing its rulers to lead the charge against their enemies in Iberia and the eastern Maghreb. The Almavorids and Almohads favored the southern city of Marrakech, while Caliph Yaqub al-Mansur attempted to establish the capital at Rabat. Some in the court argue that Meknes could also serve as a political center. Any of these cities would make a fine capital for our nation.",
