The examining Court was confined to a return of fact. It was called on to state whether the examinee was or was not guilty of heresy. Punishment was reserved to the secular authority. This arrangement did not satisfy the Court of Rome, an Inquisitor was appointed by the Pope, but he required the Doge's exequatur before he could act, and a board was created of three Venetian nobles, to sit as assessors to the Holy Office. Their duty was to guard the rights of Venetian citizens against ecclesiastical encroachment, including the non-interference in religious matters within the colonies, without their presence and their sanction no act of the Holy Office was valid in Venice.

The same act provided the general populace with the right to complain about the actions of justices directly to the monarch or his council. The appointment of the justices by the Lord Chancellor at irregular annual intervals allowed for the possible removal of uncooperative gentlemen at the next annual re-issue of the commissions.",

Things began to fray around the edges when Mary Queen of Scots fled to England. The problem for Elizabeth I was that Mary was a Catholic claimant to the English throne. Elizabeth I had Mary locked away in various castles, but she still became the center of numerous conspiracies to overthrow the upstarts who had displaced the ancient aristocracy. Their basic idea was to marry Mary to Norfolk, England's only Duke. This combination represented a serious threat to Elizabeth I but Norfolk seemed undecided and continued to delay until Elizabeth I invited him to London whereupon she locked him in the Tower. Elizabeth I suspected that the Earls of Northumberland, Westmorland and Cumberland were involved in the conspiracy and invited them to London as well. The Earls guessed their accommodation would be the Tower and opted instead for a rebellion which began at about midnight on the 9 November 1569. The Catholic faith had survived in the North and there was real resentment against the extension of Tudor domination and Elizabeth I's new men. The Earl of Northumberland mustered his troops in Richmond on the 16 November. Sir George was appointed provost marshal and martial law was declared. Elizabeth I ordered that 700 of the riffraff be executed, 200 of these were to be from or around Richmond. How many were actually executed is not known but seemingly it was a smaller number, perhaps around 57, 12 of whom were from Richmond. The decade after the Rebellion was a difficult period for Catholics who faced constant persecution. Religious meetings were held in secret, away from the eyes of unfriendly informants. It seems, however, that the few gentry who were accused in court of holding Catholic beliefs were the 'mere tip of a great pyramid' which represented a hidden underground movement.",

By March 8 the majority against him was one vote, and on March 25 Parliament was dissolved. In 1788 he signed the Triple Alliance between Britain, Prussia, and Holland, thereby ensuring that in a future war his country would not be bereft of allies as it had been during the American Revolution. In 1790 he demonstrated Britain's renewed power and prestige by negotiating a peace between Austria and Turkey. In 1784 he passed his own India Act, creating a board of control regulating Indian affairs and the East India Company. Finally, in 1791 the Canada Constitutional Act was passed. London became responsible for the government of both Lower and Upper Canada, but both provinces were given representative assemblies.",

The turning point would come the following month, with the Great Fire of Paris, 1651. The fire broke out in what is today the sixth arrondissement, and while containing Palais Royal, the Hôtel de Ville, and the Notre Dame Cathedral would be out of danger, separated from the fire by the Seine River, it soon became clear that everything south of the river was in grave jeopardy. The confusion between the Swedish-speaking administrators and their French-speaking firefighter subordinates left the response effort disjointed and chaotic, though a heroic effort tried to save it, the still-new Pont Royal burned, barring any further ability to save southern Paris. Making the matters worse, screaming, wailing refugees formed chaotic mobs. A rioting mob of the new homeless stormed what is now the 8th arrondissement, pillaging the Champs-Élysees. Only Swedish soldiers prevented the critical fourth arrondissement and the Palais Royal from receiving the same fate. Once the ashes settled, much of French Paris had vanished. King Johan saw an opportunity in the ruined remnants of his new city. He set up an official, subsidized settlement for refugees, but placed it in Saint-Germain. As the French homeless moved out of Paris for less central parts of Ile-de-France, Johan hired Maurice de Blois, the greatest architect of the day, to rebuild the areas south of the Seine in a very Scandinavian style. Johan, nervous that the nobles back in Sweden would revolt, came up with a creative solution. He invited the nobility of Sweden and Finland to resettle in southern Paris, so they would have proximity to the Palais Royal, and so Johan could keep an eye on them.",

The question of the royal succession put the very existence of the kingdom at stake, even dividing Catholics in opposing fractions. After 1589 and the murder of King Henry III, Spanish intervention transformed the civil war into an outright international conflict. The violence and hatred between Protestants and Catholics had increased all over France in the years 1562-1572. The powerful Duke of Guise (from the Lorraine province) set up a Catholic League to react against the Protestants and what he considered a weak royal power. Although he was assassinated on 23rd December 1588 upon the order of King Henry III, the League then openly revolted and refused to recognize the king or his designated heir, and called for Spanish military aid, going so far as to offer the throne to the Spanish infant. Henry III was in turn murdered but named his cousin Henry of Navarre as his heir before he died. Henry IV sought foreign aid from England and the German Protestant princes but realized that he would not be able to assert himself as King of France unless he held Paris, and the capital was resolutely Catholic.

The two were the seneschal Corfitz Ulfeldt and the governor of Norway Hannibal Sehested, who were both married to Frederik's half-sisters. The king's heroic conduct during the siege of Copenhagen in the winter of 1659 had, in addition, made him widely popular at a time when the nobility and the Rigsråd were increasingly being discredited. In October 1660, these events led the estates - the nobility only reluctantly - to create a hereditary monarchy. The new system meant that the king was no longer dependent on the Rigsråd, and he immediately used his new power to introduce absolutism, which was temporarily established on 10 January 1661 in the Hereditary Monarchy Act before being fully set out in Kongeloven (the King's Law) of 1665, the basic law of Danish absolutism.",

Dominating the king, he became the lover of Queen Caroline Matilda in 1770. He was soon able to abolish the council of state and the office of statholder (governor) of Norway in 1770. In June 1771 he had the king name him privy Cabinet minister, and in July he was made a count. From March 1771 until January 1772 Struensee introduced a number of reforms, including freedom of the press, reduction of peasant labor service, a unitary judiciary, and reform of Copenhagen's municipal government. Having alienated many officials, however, he was the victim of a conspiracy in January 1772, when he was arrested and tortured to death for his liaison with the queen.",

In that very moment Jan Sobieski had such status and personal power coming from his very person that he could have ended the stagnation of Poland or at least he could have tried. Merely the different political climate during the earlier days of his reign is a proof of him being a very special monarch. He was never that limited by vetoes or articles as earlier monarchs, but in the end he chose a different path. He chose to continue the campaign against the Ottoman, a campaign he could not win decisively, while at the same time having to cope with growing dissent from magnates disliking this policy. When he stopped campaigning he suffered heavily from gallstones and he never managed to make the magnates forget that he was just one of them. He never managed to translate his popularity in the Szlachta, as whole, into concerted political action. If he instead had gone home after relieving Vienna and picked a fight with the magnates something completely different might have happened. Well who knows...?",

He was a German and because of his inability to win a war he himself had started he is considered a rather bad Polish king. However, when Friedrich Augustus became king he had a plan. He was not a stupid man, and he intended to turn the Commonwealth into a centralized monarchical state. He was a child of the same ideas as his contemporaries in Berlin, Hannover and München, and he needed a war to accomplish it. Like Sobieski, he saw war as the surest way to gain prestige and a free hand to carry out his plan. Now Friedrich Augustus made certain mistakes. He and his allies underestimated the ease with which they would smash the eighteen year old monarch of Sweden and secondly Friedrich August was no Sobieskian General. The failure of the war and his lost prestige from being a lousy soldier and having been forced to a humiliating abdication ruined every chance to reform anything. Instead he ruined any chance for monarchism in Poland as his return was with the arrivals of Russian bayonets. However... had he won the war and Poland had been a winner while Russia had become rather mauled then his position would have been different. Instead of buying art for his castles in Dresden he might very well have used that prestige and military power with boldness and brute force to accomplish the impossible...",

This elicited an immediate response from St Petersburg and Berlin, both of which threatened with war if it were not withdrawn, and if the Confederated Sejm was not immediately dissolved. The King and his supporters had little to do but comply, trapped in Warszawa as they were. But people started to wake up from their 'Saxon slumber' and the Confederates refused to comply.

Poland will raise a substantial army and support Russia in her war with the Ottomans, and make flanking maneuvers against potential attacks from Prussia or Sweden. The move was smart as it would mean that the king would have an army that could defend the country from enemies abroad and within, but Catherine did not fall for. She preferred having Poland as a piece of no-man's-land in between her and Prussia and Austria. As this failed, the King stood without a plan and a decent foreign policy. The next year members of the so-called 'Patriotic Party' took matters in their own hands in the Great Sejm. It voted an increase of the army and vested control over it in a Sejm Commission. It placed the conduct of foreign policy in the hands of another Sejm Commission. It also abolished the Permanent Council that had governed the country since 1772 and imposed tax on incomes from lands, 10 percent for the Szlachta and 20 percent for the Church. In 1791 the king arrived from his isolation since the failure with Catherine and together with Stanislaw Potocki and Hugo Kollataj he drafted the New Constitution of May 3. This became the first written Constitution in Europe and a satisfactory compromise between the republicanism of Potocki, the radicalism of Kollataj and the monarchism of the king. Again Catherine the Great reacted, and as circumstances went against Poland, peace was signed between the Ottomans and Russia, and 89000 seasoned veterans now stood against the 37000 staunchly heroic, but no less, newly recruited Poles. No one helped Poland and the outcome was devastating. Thus the Effort to end stagnation brought the Second Partition of Poland.",

        "translation": "15世纪是中国对外交流的转折时期。在此之前，中国与世界有密切的交流，诸如宗教、贸易等方方面面。唐朝时，中国与印度进行广泛的接触并使佛教传入中国。宋朝时，中国控制东南亚大部分贸易。元朝时，通过丝绸之路，穆斯林、基督徒、犹太商人都曾来到中国。1367年，朱元璋将蒙古人赶出中国后，派遣三宝太监郑和七次下南洋，最远航行至印度洋和东非海岸。但是当郑和折返后，明朝逐渐闭关锁国，直到400年后帝国主义列强用坚船利炮敲开中国的大门。当蒙古人被赶出中原后，封闭的自然环境和稳定的统治结构让中国皇帝失去了对外探索的兴趣。",

Phaulkon rose to become highly influential at the Siamese court of king Narai.

George Bruce then pointed out the rowing boat and explained that they could either use the boat or return by the tunnel from whence they came. The king relaxed and took the option of the boat journey.",

The king published a defense of witch-hunting in the 'Daemonologie' in 1597 but later became increasingly skeptical and took steps to limit prosecutions.

Topics such as 'Liberality of Princes', 'Ferocity' or 'Magnificence' was dissertated by him and he argued that architecture and great monuments were the mark of a great ruler. He could express the facts of modern life and the actualities of personal emotion in a language that was sufficiently classical yet always characteristic of the man. Urania was his ambitious didactic composition in hexameters that embodied the astronomical science of the age, adorned with a high theme of mythological episodes. He wrote in Latin and his most original compositions in verse were on personal topics — the De conjugali amore, Eridanus, Tumuli, Naeniae, Baiae - his passionate emotions were uttered with a warmth of coloring and sincerity.",

If Lithuania took a mile of Polish land it would be a mile too much. Any conquests would include more Catholics and Orthodox and worse, more unruly magnates brought up in the Polish Anarchy of a country.

To escape the egalitarian notions of the government and the king many of the mstarted to interfere in local Polish politics. Many of them owned as much lands on one as the other side of the border. They freely swapped lands with their Polish brothers and thus managed to strengthen the Cause in both Poland and Lithuania. During the Deluge the Magnates of the Ukraine and the Wild Fields fought all and everyone. Poland was in havoc and the Lithuanian king had to accept the fact that he only could control the Northern part of his lands. At these point King Aleksandras II mounted a huge campaign against the Tatars, Russians and Crimeans swapping up rebellious Magnates at the same time. He though stopped from interfering with the Polish government, 'that last sane mind on that side of the border' as he called King Wladyslaw IV of Poland. The subjugated Magnates had two options. They either had to accept a tough reform or get all their lands confiscated and pushed over the border to Poland. The choice was easy. They stayed, but the reform was harsh. Only the state could now own land. The user only owned the right to use it. But to keep that right the user had to pay a user's fee decided by the king. With this vehicle the king started to break the large estate holdings of the Magnates and again changing the structure of society. His son continued the reform policy after the King was murdered by a Ukrainian Magnate on 30th March 1654.",
