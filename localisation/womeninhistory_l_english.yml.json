When he died the Joyces tried to retake it but Gráinne Ní Mháille defended it vigorously and they became so impressed that they renamed it Caisleán na Circe, the \"Hen's Castle\".

She withstood the siege until help arrived and the English were beaten back. Having her as our advisor or admiral could be worthwhile.",

The leader of the English Reformation, the Archbishop of Canterbury Thomas Cranmer declared Henry and Catherine's marriage null and void, then declared Henry and Anne's marriage to be good and valid. The pope immediately decreed sentences of excommunication against Henry and Cranmer. This resulted in the break between the Church of England and Rome, the Church of England was brought under the King's control. Anne became pregnant quickly and the future Queen Elizabeth I was born on 7 September, 1533. Disappointed in the gender of the child, and the three miscarriages that followed, Henry started courting Jane Seymour. In order to get rid of his wife, king Henry VIII charged Anne with adultery, incest, and witchcraft and sent to the Tower of London, where she awaits trial.",

The sight of his favorite son's head made Shah Jahan fall unconscious and he remained in a stupor for many days after the incident.\\nRoshanara loves gold and land, and has gained both through corrupt methods, something that her brother frowns upon. Their relationship has deteriorated and Aurangzeb is about to strip Roshanara of her powers, banish her from his court, and order her to remain in seclusion and live a pious life in her garden palace outside of Delhi.",

She became part of Pedro de Valdivia's expedition who set out to establish the capital of the territory. Suárez treated the sick and wounded, found water for them in the desert, and saved Valdivia when one of his rivals tried to undermine his enterprise and take his life. The city was founded in a fertile vally with an abundance of fresh water but also many natives who disapproved of the new settlers. Inés de Suárez took charge and defended the city against a native attack. Clad in a coat of mail, a helmet and a hide cloak over her shoulders, she rallied the soldiers on her white horse and encouraged them with words of praise. She led the men herself and the natives was driven away from the town. Her bravery led to a victory, and had it not been for her, the city would have fallen and the colonial expansion thwarted.",

The funds for repairing the main hall of Izumo Taisha has long been gathered, but Izumo no Okuni shows no sign of stopping. Her gaudy, musical, noisy and colorful performances are called Kabuki, after the kabukimono - homeless, disaffected and displaced young and old men and women outside of the society that her troupe consists of. Kabuki started as line dance and song with no plot, but it evolved into drama with the aid of Sanzaburo Ujisato, Izumo no Okuni's lover, partner and financier. The revue is a great success, known and applauded through the whole of $COUNTRY$.",

His sister secretly adopted Nora and when her brother desired to train the young \"boy\" as a fighter, she gave her approval. Nora was trained by her father and turned out to be the most beautiful girl in the country. Her beauty has been compared to that of a mountain fairy, a Zana. Her father regretted abandoning her at the orphanage and they reconciled. When Nora was visiting a city where a pasha resided, the pasha saw her and fell madly in love. He sent a trusted man to Nora's house and asked for her hand, by the laws of the Albanian Kanun, but Nora's family refused, stating that the Albanian Kanun did not allow for marriages with non-Albanians. The pasha did not take this well, unaccustomed with such refusal and raged, \"Either Nora will become my wife or I will burn all of Malsia to ashes.\". In order to break the siege the pasha had led to her town, Nora devised a plan to kill the pasha. She went to the pasha pretending to want to marry him. After the pasha, joyous with her presence, had sent his troops away she stabbed him with a dagger, kicked him and chocked him so that he could not scream. The pasha did not die, for he fell on the ground and as it is dishonorable for an Albanian to strike a man that is not standing or not fighting back, Nora fled before she could kill him. The Albanian army attacked, and Nora returned with an army of 300 women, killing the pasha in a duel.",

The baroque had become popular and with Isabella's and Albert's patronage of artists such as Peter Paul Rubens, Pieter Brueghel the Younger, Coebergher, the De Nole family, the Van Veens and many others, the growth of this artistic movement was simulated and the Flemish Baroque painting created. The court at Brussels became full of people of all sorts, from artists and diplomats to defectors, spies and penitent traitors, from English musicians, Italian counselors, Spanish confessors, Burgundian functionaries, German bodyguards to the Belgian Nobles. Brussels is now considered a vital link in the politics of Europe, much thanks to Albert and Isabella Clara Eugenia.",

So was the case with Lucrezia Borgia, whose father Pope Alexander VI married her to three different men during her life to gain powerful alliances and founding. Her first husband was Giovanni Sforza, Lord of of Pesaro and titled Count of Catignola. He was offered Lucrezia's dowry in return for invalidating the marriage, the Pope claiming that it had not been consummated and should thus be dissolved. The Borgia family had grown so powerful that they no longer needed the Sforzas, and instead sought better alliances. Giovanni first refused, accusing Lucrezia of paternal and fraternal incest, but with the pressure from the rest of the Sforza family he finally agreed to sign confessions of impotence and documents of annulment before witnesses. Alfonso of Aragon married Lucrezia Borgia after the annulment, but the short marriage ended when he was murdered, supposedly by Lucrezia's brother Cesare. Lucrezia was appointed governor of Spoleto not long before her husband's death, and they had a child named Rodrigo of Aragon. Her third and last husband was Alfonso I d'Este, Duke of Ferrara. Lucrezia's reputation has taken a hit, with her many different marriages, murdered husband, annulment and the stain that her father and brother had brought upon her. Hopefully, with her marriage to the Duke, she can be known as a respectable and accomplished Renaissance duchess.",

From Mrs. Lydia William Bean, who Nanyehi spared when the woman was captured after an attack on Bean's settlement, she was taught a new loom weaving technique after having nursed Bean back to health. The new weaving technique changed the roles of women in the Cherokee society. The men was left to do the planting, traditionally a woman's job, when the women took on the weaving. Two dairy cows were rescued from the destroyed settlement by Mrs. Bean, who then taught Nanyehi to raise the cattle and to eat dairy products. This proved helpful as the dairy could sustain the Cherokee when hunting was bad. Chief Attakullakulla taught Nanyehi the art of diplomacy and she was much surprised when she met European diplomats as there were no women negotiators among them. Their leader was appalled, such important work should not be given to a woman! Nanyehi replied: \"You know that women are always looked upon as nothing; but we are your mothers, you are our sons.

She married the noble colonel lieutenant Hans Kyle who was in service of the army of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] and sometimes accompanied him in Germany. In $COUNTRY$, she held a salon and participated in intellectual debates, surrounding herself with scientists and artists. Her beauty and wit was admired and she was famed for her learning and academic abilities, rare qualities for her sex. \"Sexus et sæculi miraculum\" - The wonder of her time and her sex - Vendela was called by Georg Stiernhielm, something she proved at the Jesuit College in Braunsberg in East Prussia where she conducted a religious debate with learned Catholic males. She won the debate in perfect Latin, questioning the most sacred ideals of the Catholic religion.",

The second law forbade theft from the public fund or any villagers that supplied the pirates. The third law was that all goods taken as booty had to be presented and registered by a purser and then distributed by the fleet leader. 20 percent was given to the original seizer and the rest was placed in the public fund. The fourth law was that all actual money was to be turned over to the squadron leader and used to purchase supplies for unsuccessful ships.

Heo Pong introduced her to Chinese writing such as the Confucian Five Classics when she showed a natural talent for hanum verse.

He was a gifted poet who studied under a specialist of Tang poetry, Yi Tal, who took it upon him to share Tang Poetry with Nanseolheon. Tang poetry has influenced her work, shown in the naturalism of her poetry. When Nanseolheon married Kim Seongnip her poetry started to lament the plight and sufferings of married women. Her early literature employed folklore and natural imagery, common to Tang tradition, but now her poetry is weighted down with an emotive language.",
